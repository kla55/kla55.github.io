                <p>Hi everyone,</p>
                <p>I've revamped my blog post on GitHub, moving away from WordPress. It's quite exciting because I haven't dabbled in HTML for some time, and the blog is still a work in progress. This is the second iteration of the github blog. The initial attempt wasn't as tidy, and structuring the layout to serve both as a resume and a blog was challenging. However, this current iteration and design achieve the objectives I had in mind for my GitHub page.</p>
    
                <p>Thanks for reading.</p>
